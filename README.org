#+STARTUP:
* Files for configuring my working environment in Emacs

Currently running GNU Emacs 28.1 on MacOS and 27.2 on Fedora 35

I am using a number of other open users' configurations for help building my own:
  - Sacha Chua (of course!)
  - System Crafters: David Wilson
  - Mike Zamansky

and many others around the Internet whom I will add to the list as I am working on the details.
* Files, tips, and tricks
